# Express API generator

Fork of [the Express boilerplate](https://github.com/german-alvarez-dev/express-generator) by [Germán Álvarez](https://github.com/german-alvarez-dev), boiled down to its bare essentials for RESTful API development.

Database-agnostic, the user shall configure their own database connection and choose their own ORM.

## Install

- Run `npm i` on the root directory

## Run

- Create a `.env` file on the root directory to populate the database (`DB`) and port (`PORT`)
- Install your ORM of choice
- Configure your database connection
- Run `npm run dev` command on the root directory
